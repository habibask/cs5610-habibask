<p><h2>An Employee application with MongoDB, NodeJS and AngularJS</h2></p>
<h2 class="black">Experiment-1 "User authentication with PassportJS"</h2>
<p>
    In this experiment, the userlogin page is available in the login tab of the angular routing framework.
    When the information is entered, the ng-click event is triggered which passes all the information to the script file 003.js
    the script calls the method in the LoginService application which in turn makes a http call to the server.js
    <br />
    The server receives the user information and makes a local authentication call to verify.
    <br />
    In the local authentication I have included a find to the mongo db LoginDBModel and compared the login.
    On successful comparison the user info is returned back as a sign of success.
    Then the page in the url is changed to point to profile page.
    When a user logs in, only the profile and the logout tab will be available.
</p>
<h2>Experiment-2 "User Registration employee"</h2>
<p>
    The server receives the user information and inserts into the database.
    <br />
    If the insertion is successful, the user is directed to the profile page.
    <br />
    When the user is logged in we set the currentUser to the user information and use it to bind to the menu items using ng-show directive.
    This makes the selected menu items to show only when the user is not set to null or vice versa.
    When the user is logged out, the session is destroyed using the destroy() method.
</p>
<h2>Experiment-3 "Map directions"</h2>
<p>
    Worked with Google Map Apis to get the direction between source and the destination.
    First a static location in the map(in this experiment shown as Boston).
    Then based on the inputs from the user about the source and destination and the mode of transport, the directions
    are retrieved and shown in the div container.
</p>
<h2>Experiment-4 "Carousel for Main Page"</h2>
<p>
    A Carousel with images and the corresponding text that can be used in the home page of the project
    In this experiment, I worked with the simple carousel available with botstrap and customized it with images and text relevant to project

</p>
<h2>Experiment-5 "Jquery overlay effects"</h2>
           Worked with a open source script that provides the method contenthover()
                with which we can overlay one element over other on mouse over event and also decide on the animation effect
                and opacity.
