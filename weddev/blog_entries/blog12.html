<h2 class="black">Experiment-1 "Working with AngularJS show and hide"</h2>
<p>
    Experimented with directives ng-show and ng-hide to show "verify password" only if password is being typed.
    <br />
    Also there is a hidden message that the passwords donot match which is shown only when the passwords in the two inputs dont match.
</p>
<h2>Experiment-2 "Forms for User registration and Login"</h2>
<p>
    Worked on creating the login and registration forms using css and AngularJS
    <br />
    Used AngularJS for hiding showing the data and CSS for creating the forms.
</p>
<h2>Experiment-3 "Options shown specific to user profile"</h2>
<p>
    While registering the user is asked to select whether he is willing to drive the car or is looking to share a place.
</p>
<p>
    The user must register as  "you want to Drive a car" and insert his car information as basic data to register.
    <br />
    Upon successful registration an option <strong>Add a ride</strong> is displayed which is not shown when logged in "you want to share a car"
</p>
<h2>Experiment-4 "Constraints in Mongoose on the fields"</h2>
<p>
    If we apply constraints like required and unique on the schema and they are validated before entering the data inside the schema
</p>
<p>
    If the data doesnot follow the rules, errors are raised
</p>
<h2>Experiment-5 "Error messages in Register Page"</h2>
<p>
    If we apply constraints like required and unique on the schema and they are
    validated before entering the data inside the schema.
    <br />
    Error is generated like a JSON object which is then sent back as a response from the app.post() method.
    <br />
    This error is handled by the Service method which checks for the error and returns the error object to the Angular controller.
    <br />
    This error is then iterated over and shown to the message in the register.html
