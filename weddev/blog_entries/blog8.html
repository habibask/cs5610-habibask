    <p><h3>Experiment 1</h3></p>
     <p>An application with multiple navigations at the top using the angular routing concept</p>
        <p>
            In this experiment, I experimented with the concept of angular-routing by creating 3 seperate files about.html, home.html and contacts.html.
            <br />
            The pages are then linked with the routing and shown in the container of the main page using ng-view attribute, rather than just creating the hyperlinks

<p><h3>Experiment 2</h3></p>
<p>An application which demonstrates the use of angular controllers that are used in the navigation pages yet the source code remains  with the main page
                   
        <p>
            In this experiment, I worked with the concept of angular-routing along with the controller functions by creating 3 seperate files about.html, home.html and notify.html.
            <br />
            The pages are then linked with the routing and shown in the container of the main page using ng-view attribute.
            <br />
            There is a function defined on the button available in the notify page. On clicking notify me the email is registered and shown in the table below.
            This feature can be handy when we make changes to cache or database with in the same page irrespective of other pages.

    An application which takes the urls of the images as input and displays them in other page as gallery.
