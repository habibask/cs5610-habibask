<h2>Experiment-2 "Tab Layout"</h2>
<p>
    The add a ride page consists of a form where the user will add his ride to be shared.
    <br />
    The form contains source and destination fields which when entered and button is clicked shows the rout on the map.
    <br />
    Only when the source and destination are correct the user can enter the form successfully
    <br />
    There are 3 more fields for persons required, cost and proximity the can user can deviate to pick up a person.

<p>
    In the search page, I so far worked on finding out if an entered location exists on the route.
    <br />
    If the position entered lies on that particular route of all the routes available in the database, it returns true.
