<p><h2>An Book Manager application with NodeJS and AngularJS</h2></p>
<h2 class="black">Experiment-1 "search and add"</h2>
<p>
    In this experiment, I worked with the module "request" and  connected to a remote API of google books to retrieve a list of 10 books
    as per the search query of the user.
    There is a button "Add to Server" which provides the functionality to add the retrieved books.
    The retrieved books are then stored in the local array of books in the server and stored.
    Made use of the app.post() method to add the array of books passed with the request object.
</p>
<h2>Experiment-2 "Add custom entry"</h2>
<p>
    In this experiment, I worked with the module "body-parser" to convert the json into object to store in the array.
    There are input fields in the page to add new entry to the local array of the server.
    There is a button "+" which provides this functionality to add the entered books.
    The retrieved books are then stored in the local array of books in the server and stored.
</p>
<h2>Experiment-3 "Update"</h2>
<p>
    In this experiment, I worked with the functionality "put" that is used to alter any existing data in the server from the client.
    when we click pencil button on the page, the entry is editable in the input fields in the top
    There is a button "ok" which provides the functionality to update the latest books.
</p>
<h2>Experiment-4 "Delete"</h2>
<p>
    In this experiment, I worked with the functionality "put" that is used to alter any existing data in the server from the client.
    when we click pencil button on the page, the entry is editable in the input fields in the top
    There is a button "ok" which provides the functionality to update the latest books.

<h2>Experiment-5 "Setting up ruby,git and openshift to host the website"</h2>
            Installing the right versions og ruby and git and openshift took quite long time because of many issues which we could resolve only after much researching.
            Then created a clone of the project created in the openshift and moved all the contents of the local project to openshift.
            Then added,commited and pushed the updates to the remoe project.
